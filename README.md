## Memory Game

A bare-bones clone of a type of memory game that used to be bundled with some older operating systems. 

The goal of the game is to eliminate all the pieces from the table. Pieces are eliminated two at once, if they form a pair and are both uncovered during the same round (turn). A round consists of flipping over two game pieces. The two pieces are flipped back bottom-side-up if they don't form a pair.
